# Stakeholders

Three stakeholders have been identified for the project: musicians, music students, and music teachers. 

#### Musicians  

Musicians will often perform in many contexts, such as for gigs, auditions, etc. Joubert (2023) tells us that the ability to keep tempo is vital for performance and to play as the composer intended. Furthermore, the use of practice logs helps to record what has been practiced, allowing you to cover a lot of material in a short period of time without losing track. It also allows musicians to reflect in their practice time and if it is being used effectively (Dorman, 2016). 

#### Music Students 

Music students will have to learn pieces as assignments that push their abilities to improve their musical abilities. The use of a metronome is essential in learning difficult passages. A common technique among musicians at all levels is to practice at a slow speed until perfection, and then to slowly build up to the desired tempo (Duffy, 2024). The use of practice logs has been found to be useful throughout education. A study on Spanish speakers learning English found that practice logs have significant benefits to students. Feedback from tutors on their records was found to be constructive on their learning outside of lesson and helped improve the organisation of their time. The ability to reflect on learning also improved student attitude to learning as they have a physical track of their progress (Litzler, 2014). I believe very similar is achievable in music. 

#### Music Teachers 

Music teachers will often use metronomes to aid teaching, especially with beginners. Several methods have been identified by Lewis (1996) such as clapping to a metronome at various tempos to build a sense of rhythm within students. The use of logs can help teachers identify difficulties in student practice that might not be obvious within lesson. The ability to accurately see improvement helps teachers plan lessons effectively (Litzler, 2014).
