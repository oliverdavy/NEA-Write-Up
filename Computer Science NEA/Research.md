>Metronome Online

Metronome online is accessed via a web browser as a website ([https://www.metronomeonline.com/](https://www.metronomeonline.com/) Accessed at 2024/06/27). The metronome is presented as a circle where different BPMs are selected by clicking on labelled buttons around the circle. The start/stop button is prominent in the centre and shows the currently selected BPM. It also includes the Italian names for tempo. The two large arrows at the side allow for fine tuning of the tempo in increments of one BPM. Underneath the main UI is a timer for how long the metronome has run, a tap button to allow the desired metronome to be tapped in by the user, and a second timer for how long the metronome has run in total that day. Above is a small volume slider. To the left is a menu. Upon expansion (see below) the menu shows a variety of customisation options. These allow for variation in time signature, Sound style, Dark/Light mode, and to play an A at 440hz for tuning.

The expanded menu allows for greater customisation, which is not an immediate necessity, unlike the other options shown in the main menu. The time signature has two drop downs to select the number of beats and the division of said beats. There is also a further settings menu next to this. The sound style also has a drop down to select the various sound options. The dark mode and tuner are toggled by simple switches.

The time signature settings show the same drop downs as one the previous menu. It also allows adjustment to the accent on each beat from four levels (zero to three). It shows the tempo below. It also allows for different subdivisions of time to be played each beat. It allows for no subdivision, duplets, triplets, and quintuplets. There is also a reset button

##### Google Metronome
 
 (google metronome)
 
 The google metronome is accessed directly from the browser by searching for metronome. It very simply has a text box to display the current BPM, a play/pause button, and a slider to select the BPM. The drop down below links to other tools like this made by Google and is not relevant to the tool itself. The colour of the UI changes with higher and lower BPMs varying from colder colours to warmer colours.

##### Metronome Beats

(metronome beats image)

Metronome Beats is an app developed for android. It features several modes and advertises a paid pro-mode as well as linking to other apps made by the same developer. The header can open the side menu, a button which links to the tuner app, a button to buy pro-mode, and a button to open a volume slider. There are buttons at the top to pick between a few modes. The main metronome menu has lights to show which beat the metronome is on in the bar. There is also a slider which travels one full lap every two beats. The BPM indicator can be swiped up and down to pick BPM. There are also buttons to increment in ones and fives. The BPM can also be adjusted using a slider below. It also shows the corresponding Italian word for each BPM. The Beats/bar can be tapped to open a drop down to select the number of beats per bar. This updates the number of lights accordingly. The Clicks/beat also opens a drop down to adjust it when tapped. The Tap tempo button can be tapped by the user to input the BPM by tapping at the desired BPM. The bottom left button opens a tempo trainer button. There is a simple start/stop button. The bottom left button opens a timer menu.  

It also includes a simple programmable drum machine.

Add practice goals 

Edit behaviour of the log timer. Default will check for practice goals. If none it will use progress within hour. If at least one goal is set, then it will switch to goal progress. Progress within hour will just cycle between 0% to 100% every hour e.g. at 3 hours 45 mins it will show 75% because you are ¾ through the hour. Goal progress shows progress towards a set goal. E.g. if goal was 20 hours in a month and you had done 10 so far it will show 50%. Progress to fixed time setting will show how close a session is to reaching a specified time. E.g. if time set was 1 hour and you had done 15 minutes it would show ¼. 

Option to force phone to stay awake during session 

Logs can be imported and exported as CSV files as well as be wiped. Archives can also be exported or imported this way.

#### Stakeholder Needs

A google form was sent to stakeholders (musician friends). It asked what is essential in a metronome/practice tracker, and what is nice to have. 

The essentials for a metronome were: keeping track of rhythm 

- making sound 
- changing and showing speed
- range of selectable time signatures
- visual reference e.g. lights

Nice to have features of a metronome included:  

- being able to save presets
- changing the noise made
- beats per second instead of per minute  
- Vibration
- emphasis on certain beats
- ability to play over a song  
- list of popular music with their tempos and time signatures  

Essential features of practice log: 

- Date and duration of practice
- Record of what was practiced
- Notes e.g. good and bad parts, what to improve
- Ability to start and stop timer

Nice to have features of practice log: 

- Share option
- Statistics on practice
- Automatically start logging when app is open 
- Streaks (like duolingo)
- Session tags (e.g. scales, classical, etc.) perhaps linked to metronome presets 
- Attach sheet music 
- Instrument played

#### My Ideas and Approach

I agree most ideas that were presented by shareholders. I also think audio recordings should be added. Also changing visuals (theme options).
