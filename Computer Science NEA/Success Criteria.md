| 1   | Allow the user to start and stop the metronome.                                         | The metronome must be able to stop if it is to faithfully be used like its real life counterpart.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2   | Allow the user to update the BPM to a range of different values between 1BPM and 300BPM | Being able to practice pieces at/of different tempos requires the user to be able to change the tempo.                                                                                                                                            |
| 3   | Show the user a visual and audio representation of the metronome ticking                | To practice with the desired rhythm, the user must be able to experience it via one of the five senses                                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | Allow the user to start, save, and end practice sessions                                | Evaluating and reflecting on practice requires the program to be able create and save practice sessions                                                                                                                                           |
| 5   | Store the date and time of practice sessions                                            | Will allow for a criteria for practice sessions to be sorted when presented to the user e.g. Sort by most recent                                                                                                                                  |
| 6   | Allow the user to record information about the quality of practice                      | Reflecting on practice requires user input on the quality of practice, helping to show what they need to work on. This should be quantitative ( e.g. one to five Star ranking) and qualitative ( e.g. two things done well, one thing to work on) |
| 7   | Allow the user to record information about what was practiced                           | Allows for a criteria for practice sessions to be sorted when presented to the user e.g. Sort by piece                                                                                                                                            |
| 8   | Time practice sessions                                                                  | Allows for quantitative data to be collected on practice sessions which can be used for statistics (e.g. time practiced this week) and as a sorting criteria (i.e. sort by time practiced)                                                        |
| 9   | Allow user to pause practice session timer and record breaks                            | Being able to take breaks is important to practice (cite this). Recording this allows for more collection of quantative data                                                                                                                      |
