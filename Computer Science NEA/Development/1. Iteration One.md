The goal of this iteration was to layout the default UI of the metronome using the interface design sketches as reference.

First a composable for the top bar was made.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun MyTopBar(modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    Surface(  
        color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primaryContainer,  
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()  
    ){  
        Row {  
            IconButton(  
                onClick = {/* TODO */ },  
                modifier = Modifier.padding(10.dp)  
            ) {  
                Icon(  
                    imageVector = Icons.Rounded.Menu,  
                    contentDescription = "Menu Icon",  
                    modifier.size(40.dp)  
                )  
            }  
  
            Text(  
                text = "metronome",  
                fontSize = 40.sp,  
                color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary,  
                modifier = Modifier.padding(10.dp)  
            )  
        }  
    }}
```

A surface is used to add colour and define the space it will take up. Within that an icon button and text are used to define the content. These are arranged in a row to place them side by side. All colours in this app will be applied in line with the material 3 documentations found at https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/how-the-system-works. Within the main function this was placed within a column composable so subsequently made components will be placed below this one.

Then a light was created. This was done by clipping a box into a circle shape.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun MyLight(modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    Box(  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .size(60.dp)  
            .clip(CircleShape)  
            .background(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary)  
            .border(3.75.dp, Color.Black, shape = CircleShape)  
    )  
}
```

This was then used to create a light group. This was done by placing lights into a flow row. A flow row allows a row to flow over vertically, as opposed to a normal row which will cut off when the items cannot fit into to the given horizontal space. The parameter horizontalArrangement was set to space evenly so lights would fill the given space evenly, moving to a new row when necessary as it is a flow row.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun LightGroup(modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    FlowRow(  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .fillMaxWidth()  
            .padding(10.dp),  
        horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly  
    ){  
        for(i in 1..4){  
            MyLight()  
        }  
    }  
}
```

A BPM display was then made. This was created with a simple text composable with a round rectangle drawn behind to add a border. The value colour has to be defined from outside the text composable as composables can only be invoked from a composable, which drawRoundRect is not. This item was placed within a row so it would be centred without needing to fill the maximum horizontal space, as other components will need to sit beside this one.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun BPMDisplay(modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    val colour = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primaryContainer  
    Text(  
        text = "60",  
        fontSize = 50.sp,  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .drawBehind {  
                drawRoundRect(  
                    color = colour,  
                    cornerRadius = CornerRadius(10.dp.toPx()),  
                )  
            }  
            .padding(10.dp)  
    )  
}
```

Next the buttons for incrementing a decrementing were made. They simply use a button composable with an icon inside. The icon can be changed by changing the parameters of the function using an if statement.  

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun IncDecButton(inc: Boolean, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    Button(onClick = {/* TODO */}) {  
        if(inc){  
            Icon(  
                painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.baseline_add_24),  
                contentDescription = "Plus",  
                modifier = Modifier  
                    .size(40.dp)  
            )  
        }else{  
            Icon(  
                painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.baseline_remove_24),  
                contentDescription = "Minus",  
                modifier = Modifier  
                    .size(40.dp)  
            )  
        }  
    }  
}
```

These were then added on either side of the BPM display.
![IncDecButtons|300](IncDecButtons.png)
Underneath this a slider was added to control the BPM. Functionality for this will be added in a future iteration. This was created using a slider composable with a default value of sixty passed, the same as the default value of the BPM display. The slider is also given the correct amount of steps as well as the value range identified in validation of inputs.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun BPMSlider(modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {  
    Slider(  
        value = 60F,  
        onValueChange = {/*TODO*/},  
        steps = 298,  
        valueRange = 1f..300f,  
        modifier = modifier  
    )  
}
```

This was then added to main function.

The start stop button was then made. This was done similarly to the increment and decrement buttons, using an if statement to change the shown icon. However in this case the icon will change based on the state of the app.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun StartStopButton(on:Boolean, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    Button(onClick = { /*TODO*/ }) {  
        if (!on) {  
            Icon(  
                painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.baseline_play_circle_filled_24),  
                contentDescription = "Play Icon",  
                modifier.size(40.dp)  
            )  
        } else {  
            Icon(  
                painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.baseline_pause_circle_filled_24),  
                contentDescription = "Pause Icon",  
                modifier.size(40.dp)  
            )  
        }  
    }  
}
```

This was then placed in a row in the main function, as other buttons will need to be placed beside it.
![StartStop|300](StartStop.png)

The button to adjust the time signature was then made. This was done using a tonal button. A text composable is then used to show the time signature.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun TimeSig(modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    FilledTonalButton(onClick = {/*TODO*/}) {  
        Column {  
            Text(text = "4/4", fontSize = 30.sp)  
        }  
    }}
```

Then a button to adjust skip beats was added. This was effectively the same as the time signature button

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun SkipBeat(modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    FilledTonalButton(onClick = {/*TODO*/}) {  
        Column {  
            Text(text = "Skip", fontSize = 30.sp)  
        }  
    }}
```

These were both added beside the start stop button.

![TimeSkip|300](TimeSkip.png)

Finally the column holding all components in the main function was set to space evenly and to fill the maximum screen height.

This completes milestone one.
