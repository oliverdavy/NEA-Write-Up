There were several proposed features decided not to be feasible to implement which will be summarised here

| Feature                                        | Reason for exclusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Beats per second                               | Only wanted by one stakeholder. Would only complicate the program which could impede usefulness                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Attaching sheet music                          | Only wanted by one stakeholder. Would likely require users to provide their own sheet music files.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Built in list of music and their BPMs          | Would require a large amount of additional research into several genres and would require frequent updating to remain useful.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Automatically start logging when app is opened | May not be the desired function of the app, as users may wish to just review practice sessions rather than start practising, so this shouldn't be forced as the default. They may also only want to use the metronome and not use any of the practice tracking functionality. |
