The goal of this iteration was to add functionality to all of the components added in the previous iteration.

First the menu button in the top bar was made to open a navigation drawer. This was achieved using the documentation found at https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/drawer. 

To implement this a drawer state variable was made to remember the drawer state to be passed to the drawer. Then a modal navigation drawer was made. This was made very similarly to the example found in the documentation, using the drawer sheet to add text for the title and navigation drawer items to add options to navigate between the metronome and the practice tracker. Functionality for this will be added in a later iteration.

Then the drawer state is passed to the drawer as well as the content written in iteration one.

```Kotlin
val drawerState = rememberDrawerState(initialValue = DrawerValue.Closed)  
ModalNavigationDrawer(  
    drawerContent = {  
        ModalDrawerSheet {  
            Text("Metronome Practice Tracker", modifier=Modifier.padding(16.dp)) 
            HorizontalDivider()  
            NavigationDrawerItem(  
                label = {Text(text="Metronome")},  
                selected = true,  
                onClick = {/*TODO*/}  
            )  
            NavigationDrawerItem(  
                label = {Text(text="Practice Tracker")},  
                selected = false,  
                onClick = {/*TODO*/}  
            )  
        }  
    },  
    drawerState = drawerState  
) {
	//content from iteration one
```

Finally the menu buttons on click is written to set the drawer value to open by using a coroutine. 

```Kotlin
MyTopBar(iconOnClick = {scope.launch{drawerState.open()}} ,modifier = Modifier)
```

The scope variable is defined before the navigation drawer using a built in function

```Kotlin
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
```

Next functionality for the lights was added. First a variable to keep track of if the app is running was made. It used the remember API so it would retain its state even when the app rebuilds itself over its life cycle. 

```Kotlin
var running = remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
```

This is passed as a parameter into the light group function. A launched effect was written to update the lights so it doesn't block execution by using a delay function. This also means the delay will be reset when the current bpm updates. This was updated to use the calculation identified in the design section.

```Kotlin
fun LightGroup(running:Boolean, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    val currentBPM = 60  
    LaunchedEffect(currentBPM) {  
        while(running){  
            delay(1.seconds)  
			//update lights
        }  
    }
```

A variable to hold the current lights state was then made. This was a mutable integer state, where the number stored indicates which light along is to be lit up. The light group function could then be updated to update the lights correctly. To make the light roll back around to the start when the final light is passed, a modulo was used, corresponding to the current number of lights. For now the default value of four was used.

```Kotlin
currentLight.value = (currentLight.value +1 ) % 4
```

Then the individual light function was updated so they could be toggled on and off.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun MyLight(active: Boolean, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    if(active){  
        Box(  
            modifier = Modifier  
                .size(60.dp)  
                .clip(CircleShape)  
                .background(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary)  
                .border(3.75.dp, Color.Black, shape = CircleShape)  
        )  
    }else{  
        Box(  
            modifier = Modifier  
                .size(60.dp)  
                .clip(CircleShape)  
                .background(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.secondary)  
                .border(3.75.dp, Color.Black, shape = CircleShape)  
        )  
    }  
}
```

Finally the for loop which draws the lights within the light group function could be updated to draw lights on if they correspond to the currently stored value. It was also placed within a key so the flow row would recompose every time the current light value changes showing the change. 

```Kotlin
key(currentLight.value){  
    FlowRow(  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .fillMaxWidth()  
            .padding(10.dp),  
        horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly  
    ){  
        for(i in 0..3){  
            if(i == currentLight.value) MyLight(active = true, modifier = Modifier)  
            else MyLight(active = false, modifier = Modifier)  
        }  
    }  
}
```

Next the increment and decrement buttons were given functionality. To achieve this a variable to hold the current bpm was made. Any functions which had been using the default values were updated to use this instead. Next the on click function of the buttons were moved to be parameters instead of being within the function.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun IncDecButton(onClick: () -> Unit, inc: Boolean, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    Button(onClick = {onClick()}) {
```

The function calls were then updated to use these. 

```Kotlin
IncDecButton(onClick = {currentBPM.value--}, inc = false, modifier = Modifier)  
IncDecButton(onClick = {currentBPM.value++}, inc = true, modifier = Modifier)
```

A key was also implemented to make sure the bpm display updates.

```Kotlin
key(currentBPM.value){  
    Text(  
        text = currentBPM.value.toString(),  
        fontSize = 50.sp,  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .drawBehind {  
                drawRoundRect(  
                    color = colour,  
                    cornerRadius = CornerRadius(10.dp.toPx()),  
                )  
            }  
            .padding(10.dp)  
    )  
}
```

Next the slider was updated to be functional. First the current bpm was added as a parameter. Then a slider position variable was created. Finally the on value change was updated to update the current bpm correctly, as well as the slider position. A key was also used so that the slider also updates if the bpm is changed via the increment and decrement buttons, but not from the bpm slider itself. This is necessary as if the bpm slider updated and recomposed itself it would not be draggable. This was done by making the increment and decrement buttons toggle a boolean every time they're pressed. The end result was this function

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun BPMSlider(currentBPM: MutableState<Int>, modifier: Modifier) {  
    key(currentBPM.value){  
        var sliderPosition by remember{ mutableFloatStateOf(currentBPM.value.toFloat())}  
        Slider(  
            value = sliderPosition,  
            onValueChange = {sliderPosition = it; currentBPM.value = it.toInt()},  
            steps = 298,  
            valueRange = 1f..300f,  
            modifier = modifier  
        )  
    }  
}
```

Next functionality was added to the start stop button. This was done by passing an on click function to the button which sets the value of the running variable to its inverse.

```Kotlin
fun StartStopButton(onClick:() -> Unit, on:Boolean, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){
```

```Kotlin
StartStopButton(onClick = {running.value = !running.value;}, on = running.value, modifier = Modifier)
```

This completes milestone two and three, and as such the relevant test plans were performed.

Once testing was complete remedial action was taken to correct any failed tests.

Test three was remedied by adding an if clause before incrementing the current light value.  If it is detected to be invalid it is set to 0, which is always valid regardless of conditions. The function caused a crash on -1 and 4 as it causes the code which draws the lights to attempt to read out of range in the skips tracking array.

```Kotlin
if(currentLight.value > beats.value  || currentLight.value < 0) currentLight.value = 0  
currentLight.value = (currentLight.value + 1) % beats.value
```

Repeating the test gave the expected result, meaning it passed.

Test five was also remedied using two if clauses before the delay is calculated to validate the BPM.If it was found to be invalid it will set BPM to 1 or 300, whichever is closer to the invalid value. zero and negative one caused crashes as the delay function only accepts positive non-zero values.

```Kotlin
if(currentBPM.value > 300) currentBPM.value = 300  
if(currentBPM.value < 1) currentBPM.value = 1  
delay((240_000L*(currentBPM.value).toLong())/(subDivision.value))
```

Repeating the test gave the expected result, meaning it passed.

Test six was remedied by adding an if clause to stop the change of value if it would cause an invalid value.
```Kotlin
//for decrement
onClick = {if(currentBPM.value-1!=0)currentBPM.intValue--}
//for increment
if(currentBPM.value+1!=301)currentBPM.intValue++
```

If it is already invalid it will be caught by the validation in the remedy to test five.

These changes meant repeating the test gave the expected result, meaning it passed.

Next the time signature button was made to open a menu that can adjust the time signature. Tho achieve this first a composable was made containing a dialog composable. This dialog then contains an elevated card. The dialog requires an on dismiss request function to be passed so that was added as a parameter to the higher function. The card was then made to fill the maximum width and have a height of two hundred dp as well as a padding of sixteen dp.

To implement opening and closing the dialog, a variable was made to hold if the menu is open or not. an if statement is then used to make sure the dialog only shows if this variable is true. The passed on dismiss request function was then made to set the variable to false, closing the menu. An on click function is also sent to the change time signature button, setting the variable to true.

```Kotlin
var timeSigOpen = remember { mutableStateOf(false)}  
if(timeSigOpen.value){  
    ChangeTimeSig(onDismissRequest = {timeSigOpen.value = false})  
}  
TimeSig(onClick = {timeSigOpen.value = true}, modifier = Modifier)
```

The card was then populated with a title (made with a text composable) and two sliders, one to select the number of beats (the top number), and the one for the subdivision (the bottom number).  These were both given an initial value of four. Both sliders were given a value range that fitted with the range identified in the validation of inputs. Unfortunately, ranges in Kotlin can only increase or decrease linearly, i.e. only arithmetic progressions could be made. The range of the bottom numbers however must be powers of two, which is a geometric sequence. To get around this, two variables are used for the bottom number, one to store the sliders actual position, which can vary from one to four, and one to hold the actual value, which is simply two raised to the power of the previous variable.

The composables within the card were also styled appropriately, adding paddings and adjusting text size and weight where necessary. Finally the top and bottom numbers were made to be parameters passed to the function, as well as variables being made for those in the main function. Any composables dependant on these were updated to use them as well.

This resulted in this composable function.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun ChangeTimeSig(beats:MutableState<Int>, subDivision:MutableState<Int>, onDismissRequest:() -> Unit, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    Dialog(onDismissRequest = {onDismissRequest()}){  
        ElevatedCard (  
            modifier = Modifier  
                .fillMaxWidth()  
                .height(300.dp)  
                .padding(16.dp)  
        ){  
            Text(  
                text = "Time Signature",  
                fontSize = 24.sp,  
                modifier = modifier.padding(10.dp)  
            )  
            Text(  
                text = beats.value.toString(),  
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center,  
                modifier=modifier  
                    .padding(10.dp)  
                    .wrapContentSize(Alignment.Center)  
                    .fillMaxWidth()  
            )  
            Slider(  
                value = beats.value.toFloat(),  
                onValueChange = {beats.value = it.toInt()},  
                steps = 14,  
                valueRange = 1f..16f,  
                modifier = modifier.padding(10.dp)  
            )  
  
            var bottomSliderPosition = remember{mutableFloatStateOf(log(subDivision.value.toFloat(),2f))}  
            subDivision.value = 2.0.pow(bottomSliderPosition.value.toDouble()).toInt()  
            Text(  
                text = subDivision.value.toString(),  
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center,  
                modifier=modifier  
                    .padding(10.dp)  
                    .wrapContentSize(Alignment.Center)  
                    .fillMaxWidth()  
            )  
            Slider(  
                value = bottomSliderPosition.value,  
                onValueChange = {bottomSliderPosition.value = it},  
                steps = 3,  
                valueRange = 0f..4f,  
                modifier = modifier.padding(10.dp)  
            )  
        }  
    }
}
```

Next the skip beats functionality was added. First a list of booleans was created to hold the intensity of each beat, false meaning it is skipped, true meaning it is played. As beats are currently done from zero to n, where n is the number of beats, the index can be used to refer to each beat. This was given a default of four Trues. 

```Kotlin
var trackSkips = remember { mutableListOf( listOf(true,true,true,true)) }
```

A new composable was then made to hold the menu for allowing the user to adjust these values. This was implemented very similarly to the previous menu, using a dialog and elevated card, simply having different content within. It also opened and closed in the same manner, using a boolean to hold if it's open or not, and an if statement to show the composable. 

To allow the user to toggle the beats on and off, a switch is used. To create all the toggles and labels required a for loop is used. A function was also made to update the length of the skip beat tracking list when the amount of beats changes. The card was also made to be scrollable so all switches could be fitted no matter how many are required. 

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun ChangeSkip(beats:MutableState<Int>, trackSkips:MutableList<Boolean>, onDismissRequest:() -> Unit, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    Dialog(onDismissRequest = {onDismissRequest()}){  
        ElevatedCard (  
            modifier = Modifier  
                .fillMaxWidth()  
                .height(300.dp)  
                .padding(16.dp)  
        ){  
            Text(  
                text = "Skip beats",  
                fontSize = 24.sp,  
                modifier = modifier.padding(10.dp)  
            )  
            Column(modifier = Modifier  
                .fillMaxWidth()  
                .fillMaxHeight()  
                .verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())){  
                for(i in 0..<beats.value){  
                    Row( horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()) {  
                        Text(text="Beat ${i+1}", fontSize = 32.sp)  
                        Switch(  
                            checked = trackSkips[i],  
                            onCheckedChange = { trackSkips[i] = it}  
                        )  
                    }  
                }  
            }  
  
        }    }}
```

```Kotlin
var trackSkips = remember { mutableStateListOf(true,true,true,true) }
```

```Kotlin
fun updateTrackSkips(trackSkips: SnapshotStateList<Boolean>, newLen: Int): SnapshotStateList<Boolean> {  
    if(trackSkips.size == newLen){  
        return trackSkips  
    }else if(trackSkips.size > newLen){  
        while(trackSkips.size > newLen){  
            trackSkips.removeAt(trackSkips.size-1)  
        }  
    }else if(trackSkips.size < newLen){  
        while(trackSkips.size < newLen){  
            trackSkips.add(true)  
        }  
    }  
    return trackSkips  
}
```

To complete the functionality of this, lights were updated to remain off if they are false in the skip beats list. This was implemented by simply updating an if statement.

```Kotlin
for(i in 0..<beats.value){  
    if(i == currentLight.value && trackSkips[i]) MyLight(active = true, modifier = Modifier)  
    else MyLight(active = false, modifier = Modifier)  
}
```

finally, to complete this iteration, vibration and sound effects were added to every played beat. First vibration was added This was done by calling the vibration manager from the light group and playing a vibration every played beat.

Then sound effects were added. A media player is called and given the same context the vibration manager used as well as an audio file of a metronome tick courtesy of https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/metronome/. Then the media is played on every played beat, and then rewound back to the start of the audio and paused at the end of each beat. Overall the function handling light update delay looked like this.

```Kotlin
while (running) {  
    if(currentBPM.value > 300) currentBPM.value = 300  
    if(currentBPM.value < 1) currentBPM.value = 1  
    if(trackSkips[currentLight.value]){  
        mediaPlayer.start()  
        vibrator.vibrate(VibrationEffect.createOneShot(100L, VibrationEffect.DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE))  
    }  
	delay((240_000L*(currentBPM.value).toLong())/(subDivision.value))
    mediaPlayer.seekTo(0)  
    mediaPlayer.pause()  
    if(currentLight.value > beats.value  || currentLight.value < 0) currentLight.value = 0  
    currentLight.value = (currentLight.value + 1) % beats.value  
}
```
