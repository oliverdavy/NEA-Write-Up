The goal of this iteration was to implement functionality to the practice tracker.

First a database was implemented. Android has SQLITE built in with its Room API (the instructions for using this can be found at: https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) 

To implement this a data class Session was created and given a primary key in accordance with the official documentation and what was defined in the design of the solution.

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "sessions")
data class Session (
	@PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
	@ColumnInfo(name = "date") var date: String = "",
	@ColumnInfo(name = "info") var info: String = ""
)
```

A data access object (DAO) was then created to allow for interacting with the database. This used the built in functions as well as custom SQL queries defined in the design section.

```Kotlin
@Dao  
interface SessionDao {  
    @Query("SELECT * FROM sessions ORDER BY id DESC")  
    fun getAll(): List<Session>  
  
    @Query("SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE id like :id")  
    fun getById(id: Int): Session  
  
    @Insert()  
    fun insert(vararg sessions: Session)  
  
    @Update()  
    fun update(session: Session)  
  
    @Delete()  
    fun delete(vararg sessions: Session)  
}
```

Then an AppDatabase class was defined to allow for the database to be created in the execution of the app. 

```Kotlin
@Database(entities = [Session::class], version = 1)  
abstract class AppDatabase : RoomDatabase() {  
    abstract fun sessionDao(): SessionDao  
}
```

This was then called in the Main Activity file so it could be passed to any screens which required it. 

```Kotlin
val db = Room.databaseBuilder(  
    applicationContext,  
    AppDatabase::class.java, "sessions-database"  
).allowMainThreadQueries().build()
```

The practice tracker composable which held the practice tracker screens UI was then given a new parameter so the database could be passed to it. Using this a new sessions variable was made within which would hold all of the sessions within the database, which it retrieves using the functions defined by the DAO.

```Kotlin
var sessions = remember { db.sessionDao().getAll() as MutableList<Session> }
```

This was then used in the lazy list to display all of the practice session currently stored.

```Kotlin
var sessions = remember { getAllSessions(db) }  
    LazyColumn(horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally, verticalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {  
        item{  
            Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))  
        }  
        items(sessions.size){index ->  
            EntryPreview(session = sessions[index], db = db, sessions = sessions, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth())  
            Spacer(modifier = Modifier.size(16.dp))  
        }  
    }
```

The drop down to delete session was also updated to make use of this, by removing it from the database using the function created earlier. 

```Kotlin
DropdownMenuItem(  
    text = { Text("Delete") },  
    onClick = { db.sessionDao().delete(session) }  
)
```

This completed the functionality of the practice trackers ability to show and delete sessions.
