# Computational Methods

This project is suitable for being solved computationally for several reasons. 

A metronome requires precise timing and works via logical steps to achieve its intended goal of keeping a consistent, user defined beats. These are both properties very well suited to computers, which follow logical steps and act very precisely. 

Practice logs require the ability to store and retrieve data, and for the implementation in this project it also needs to keep track of time and calculate statistics. Computers are able to store and retrieve data quickly and accurately, as well as perform complex calculations quickly. 

Furthermore, a computers ability to perform tasks concurrently would allow the practice log and metronome to be used at the same time, making this solution very versatile in its use.
