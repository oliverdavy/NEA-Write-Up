# Features

The features to be added will have an essentiality level assigned. 

High = An essential feature for the app to be successful 

Medium = A feature that would greatly improve the apps usefulness, but not essential e.g. log notes 

Low = A feature that would be useful but not detrimental to the app if not included e.g. attach sheet music 

This is also affected by what stakeholders think is essential and what is useful
