| Playing the metronome set at 60 bpm 4/4 should play a constant ticking, vibration, and update the lights at a larghetto speed when played. This then stops when it is paused                  | The metronome should be able to handle common time tempo's, which this is an example of. This covers success criteria 1, 2, and 3.                                                                                                                              |
| Playing the metronome at 166 bpm 5/4 skipping beats one and three should play at a predictable interval at a vivace speed                                                                     | The metronome should be able at more unconventional settings and still be useful. This is an example of an odd time signature, with emphasis being implied on beats two and four. This also covers success criteria 1, 2 and 3, making sure of a full coverage. |
| A new practice session can be made and timed. Notes can be made easily via keyboard input. This is then saved to the database and displayed as a preview on the main practice tracker screen. | The solution should be able to save practice sessions correctly and store these for the user to reflect on.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Practice sessions can be deleted, updating the main screen in real time.                                                                                                                      | The user should be able to remove practice sessions.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
