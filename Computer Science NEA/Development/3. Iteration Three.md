The goal of this iteration was to test the usability of the metronome. This was performed by conducting testing sessions with stakeholders to identify what they thought of the solution. They were asked to identify how useful each feature was and how easy it was to use, and then to suggest any features they'd like changed. 
Whilst all features scored highly in both categories, there were still some requests for changes, which are described in the table below.

| Feature requested      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Justification                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Numbered lights        | Lights would be given a small caption with a number from 1 to n, where n is the number of lights                                                                                                                                                                                        | This would make it faster to identify which beat is which. This would be especially helpful with a large amount of beats e.g. 11/8                                       |
| Display lights equally | Lights would arrange themselves evenly. Currently light display is presented in a non-intuitive way as the program tries to fit as many as possible (five) on to one line.                                                                                                              | This would make it easier for the musicians eyes to track the metronome                                                                                                  |
| Emphasis on beat one   | The first beat of a bar would be louder in vibration and sound                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | This would help the musician keep track of where the down beat is.                                                                                                       |
| Subdivisions           | On sheet music, the musician is not simply given a bpm, instead they are told what note value has that bpm, e.g. quarter note = 60 bpm. This feature would allow the note value to be set, as currently the metronome assumes it is the same as the bottom number of the time signature | This would significantly improve how useful the metronome is when used in conjunction with sheet music, allowing the musician to set it exactly as the composer intended |
| Holding buttons        | This would allow the increment and decrement buttons to be held down, increasing or decreasing bpm at a faster rate.                                                                                                                                                                    | This would increase the speed of use, meaning the musician spends less time setting up and more time playing.                                                            |
These were then implemented in order.

To implement the light captions a Text composable was added that displayed the to the Light composable made in iteration one. This was placed after the main body within a column and centred horizontally. A new parameter was added to the composable to give the lights number. 

```Kotlin
@Composable
fun MyLight(active: Boolean, number: String, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){
    Column(horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
        if(active){
            Box(
                modifier = Modifier
                    .size(60.dp)
                    .clip(CircleShape)
                    .background(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary)
                    .border(3.75.dp, Color.Black, shape = CircleShape)
            )
        }else{
            Box(
                modifier = Modifier
                    .size(60.dp)
                    .clip(CircleShape)
                    .background(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.secondary)
                    .border(3.75.dp, Color.Black, shape = CircleShape)
            )
        }
        Text(number)
    }
}
```
>New light composable

(insert image here!!)

Next the light group was configured to display in a more natural manner. It was decided this meant displaying in groups of fours, as this is a very common number to count in for musicians. This was done by simply updating the flow row within the light group composable to use it built-in maxItemsInEachRow parameter, which is set to the max integer limit by default. This was changed to four to achieve the desired affect.

```Kotlin
FlowRow(  
    maxItemsInEachRow = 4,  
    modifier = Modifier  
        .fillMaxWidth()  
        .padding(10.dp),  
    horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly  
){  
    for(i in 0..<beats.value){  
        MyLight(active = (i==currentLight.value && trackSkips[i]), number = (i+1).toString(), modifier = Modifier)  
    }  
}
```
>New flow row

Adding emphasis on beat one was achieved by first wrapping he existing code in an if statement, checking if the beat is not equal to one. An else clause was then used to play a longer vibration and a different sound.

```Kotlin
if(currentLight.value != 0){  
    val mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer.create(context, com.example.MPT.R.raw.bigclick)  
    mediaPlayer.start()  
    vibrator.vibrate(VibrationEffect.createOneShot(50L, VibrationEffect.DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE))  
}else{  
    val mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer.create(context, com.example.MPT.R.raw.tick)  
    mediaPlayer.start()  
    vibrator.vibrate(VibrationEffect.createOneShot(100L, VibrationEffect.DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE))  
}
```
