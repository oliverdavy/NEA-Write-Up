In the study, teaching, and performance of music the ability to practice effectively and efficiently is vital to success. A tool used for centuries is the metronome, a simple tool to create a consistent beat at a variable tempo. As well as this, one of the best ways to accelerate progress in practice is to use a practice log, a tool well renowned for its effectiveness throughout learning which helps learners keep a consistent track of what has been achieved, how it has been achieved, and where to improve next.  

I believe that to make musical practice more effective these tools should both be accessible together in a convenient location since they are both used within the same context, practice. 

My program will enable the user to set up a metronome to their requirements and be able to use this to aid their practice as they need it to, since this is not necessarily the same for all musicians (e.g. many jazz musicians will practice with the metronome only on two and four). It should also enable the user to write practice logs in a practical and structured manner, allowing them to record information effectively and quickly. Ideally it should also allow video or audio recordings to self-reflect on tone and technique.
