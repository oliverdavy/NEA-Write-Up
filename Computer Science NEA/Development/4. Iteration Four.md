The goal of this iteration was to layout the basic UI of the practice tracker using the interface design sketches as references.

To achieve this, first navigation to the practice tracker had to be implemented. 
A variable to hold which part of the app was currently open was made. 

```Kotlin
var currentScreen = remember { mutableStateOf("Metronome") }
```

The on click functions within the navigation drawer were then updated to make use of this.

```Kotlin
NavigationDrawerItem(  
    label = {Text(text="Metronome")},  
    selected = true,  
    onClick = {currentScreen.value = "Metronome"}  
)  
NavigationDrawerItem(  
    label = {Text(text="Practice Tracker")},  
    selected = false,  
    onClick = {currentScreen.value = "Practice Tracker"}  
)
```

The composables that made up the metronome were then placed into one composable. The contents of the main function was then substituted with this. 

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun Metronome(){
//...
//the metronome portion of the app
//...
}
```

This did not include the top bar, as it would be present in both screens, only changing title to match the current screen. This was also implemented. 

Next an if else statement was used to display the correct composable based on the current app state. This implementation makes the metronome screen the default. 

```Kotlin
MyTopBar(title = currentScreen, iconOnClick = {scope.launch{drawerState.open()}} ,modifier = Modifier)  
if(currentScreen.value == "Practice Tracker"){  
	//practice tracker composable call goes here
}else{  
    Metronome()  
}
```

Then the practice tracker composable was made to hold all of the components necessary for this part of the app.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun PracticeTracker(){  
  
}
```

Following the interface design sketch, first a composable for the cards which represent completed practice sessions was made. This was done using an elevated card which took arguments for the date and content. 

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun EntryPreview(date: String, content: String, modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {  
    ElevatedCard(  
        colors = CardDefaults.cardColors(  
            containerColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceVariant  
        ),  
        elevation = CardDefaults.cardElevation(  
            defaultElevation = 6.dp  
        ),  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .size(width = 350.dp, height = 200.dp)  
    ) {  
        Text(  
            text = date,  
            modifier = Modifier  
                .padding(16.dp),  
            textAlign = TextAlign.Center,  
            fontSize = 20.sp  
        )  
        Text(  
            text = content,  
            modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp),  
            textAlign = TextAlign.Left,  
            overflow = TextOverflow.Ellipsis  
            )  
    }  
}
```

A drop down menu was also added to give the user the ability to delete sessions, as well as add the capability for further functionality to possible be added in the future. This was implemented by wrapping a box around the title to display this in the top right corner of the preview. The drop down was then added using the official documentation on drop down given at https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/menu

```Kotlin
Box( modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()){  
    Text(  
        text = session.date,  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .padding(16.dp),  
        textAlign = TextAlign.Center,  
        fontSize = 20.sp  
    )  
    var expanded = remember { mutableStateOf(false) }  
    Box(  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .padding(16.dp)  
            .align(Alignment.TopEnd)  
    ) {  
        IconButton(onClick = { expanded.value = !expanded.value }) {  
            Icon(Icons.Default.MoreVert, contentDescription = "More options")  
        }  
        DropdownMenu(  
            expanded = expanded.value,  
            onDismissRequest = { expanded.value = false }  
        ) {  
            DropdownMenuItem(  
                text = { Text("Delete") },  
                onClick = {/*TODO*/}
	        }
```





To display several of these in a column, a lazy list was used to display them in the most efficient manner. 

Within the lazy list items are used to display composables in an iterative manner given a number of items, and an item is used to display a single composable. An items was used with a default value of two to display two example entry previews. A spacer was then added using an item to add some padding between the entry previews and the top bar.

 ```Kotlin
LazyColumn(horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally, verticalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {  
    item{  
        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))  
    }  
    items(sessions.size){index ->  
        EntryPreview(session = sessions[index], db = db, sessions = sessions, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth())  
        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.size(16.dp))  
    }
```

A new composable was then written to add a floating action button which would be used to open the screen to make a new practice session. This was done using the built in floating action button composable passing an onClick function as a parameter, as well as an icon to visually indicate its purpose

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun StartNew(onClick: () -> Unit, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    FloatingActionButton(  
        onClick = {onClick()},  
        modifier = modifier  
    ){  
        Icon(Icons.Filled.Create, "create new session")  
    }  
}
```

This was placed on the bottom right corner wrapping a box composable around the lazy list and the floating action button and giving button an alignment to the bottom end.

```kotlin

LazyColumn(horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally, verticalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {  
        item{  
            Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))  
        }  
        items(sessions.size){index ->  
            EntryPreview(session = sessions[index], db = db, sessions = sessions, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth())  
            Spacer(modifier = Modifier.size(16.dp))  
        }  
    }StartNew(  
    onClick = {openNewSession()},  
    modifier = Modifier  
        .align(Alignment.BottomEnd)  
        .padding(16.dp)  
)
```

This completed the basic UI layout for the practice tracker.
