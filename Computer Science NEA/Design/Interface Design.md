Several sketches were made to show how the end product may look and how it might be used.

![Metronome Sketch](MetronomeSketch.png)

This sketch encapsulates all the main functionality that would be found within the metronome. The top bar contains an icon which would open a drawer for the user to navigate to the practice tracker (a common feature of android apps with multiple screens).

The lights are placed at the top and change colour, as described earlier. The current BPM is shown clearly In the centre of the screen. This box should be able to be typed in by the user. There are also buttons along side to increment and decrement the BPM. As the final BPM control there is also a slider. A slider acts as a convenient method of making larger changes to BPM quickly when precision may not be needed, as well as not requiring input validation as it is only possible to enter a discreet set of values with a slider.

Below this are buttons to open a pop-up menu with which the user can alter the time signature and skip beats. There is also a button to stop and start the metronome.

This sketch shows how the navigation layout would be laid out. This is very typical for android apps.

![Practice Tracker](PracticeSketch.png)

This sketch shows how the practice tracker might look. It shows previews for recent entries which the user could browse and interact with to perform tasks such as viewing previous sessions in full or editing/deleting sessions. The user can also use the button at the bottom to open a screen to create a new practice session.

![New session](NewSession.png)

Finally, this sketch shows how a practice session might be displayed. There is a timer to keep track of the session's length as well as a pause button to control when it is running. There is a stop button to end the session as well as a large text field for the user to enter notes.
