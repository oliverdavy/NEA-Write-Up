The goal of this iteration was to enable the user to be able to create new practice sessions.

First a new composable was created called NewSession to hold all the contents for a new screen which the user would use to create a new session

```Kotlin
@Composable 
fun NewSession(){

}
```

A composable was then written to display a timer. This took a value for time in seconds and then used the modulo operator and string formatting to display this in hours:minutes:seconds. The timer was also made to increment itself at a period of one second using a similar technique to the light group in the metronome.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun Timer(currentTime: MutableState<Int>, running: Boolean, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
	LaunchedEffect(running, currentTime.value) {  
	    while(running) {  
	        delay(1000L)  
	        currentTime.value++  
	    }  
	}
    val colour = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primaryContainer  
    val seconds = (currentTime.value) % 60  
    val minutes = (currentTime.value % 3600) / 60  
    val hours = (currentTime.value) / 3600  
    Text(  
        text = String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", hours, minutes,seconds ),  
        fontSize = 50.sp,  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .drawBehind {  
                drawRoundRect(  
                    color = colour,  
                    cornerRadius = CornerRadius(10.dp.toPx()),  
                )  
            }  
            .padding(10.dp)  
    )  
}
```

This was then added into the NewSession composable.

An End button was also created. This was simply a button with an icon inside. The buttons on click is passed in a  parameter.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun EndButton(onClick: () -> Unit, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    Button(onClick = {onClick()},){  
        Icon(  
            painter = painterResource(id = com.example.MPT.R.drawable.stop_24dp_e8eaed_fill1_wght400_grad0_opsz24),  
            contentDescription = "Stop Icon",  
            modifier.size(40.dp)  
        )  
    }  
}
```

This was placed in a column with the timer.

The Start Stop button was also reused directly from the metronome, with the passed function now setting a variable within the NewSession which tracks if the timer should be running. This was placed in a row with the End button

Variables were also created to add functionality, as well as having the database being hoisted from the top level declaration. A function to handle closing the practice tracker was passed as well which is what the stop button uses on click. This function was declared at the top level to navigate back to the practice tracker. All of the methods required to be passed into the functions were written using these variables. was declared at the top level to navigate back to the practice tracker.

```Kotlin
@Composable  
fun NewSession(db: AppDatabase, onClose: () -> Unit, modifier: Modifier = Modifier){  
    var sessionToWrite = remember { mutableStateOf(Session()) }  
    var currentTime = remember { mutableIntStateOf(0)}  
    var running = remember { mutableStateOf(true) }  
    var info = remember { mutableStateOf("") }  
    var date = SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd").format(Calendar.getInstance().time)  
    Column(horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally, verticalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {  
        Timer(currentTime = currentTime, running = running.value, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth())  
        Row(horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()){  
            StartStopButton(onClick = {running.value = !running.value}, on = running.value, modifier = Modifier)  
            EndButton(onClick = {onClose(); sessionToWrite.value.info = info.value; sessionToWrite.value.date = "$date - ${formatSeconds(currentTime.value)}"; addSession(db,sessionToWrite.value)})  
        }  
        EnterInfo(info, modifier = Modifier)  
    }  
}
```

This completed the functionality for the practice tracker and is ready for user testing.
