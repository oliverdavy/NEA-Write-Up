## Systems Diagram

(Systems diagrams)

not yet finished 

top is the program

second layer is broad ideas of the program

further down is more specific

no actual specific solving e.g. store with SQL is a thing you shouldn’t say

each branch end corresponds to a subroutine

## Interface Design

(three sketches each of metronome and practice log)

## Validation of Inputs

(format checking table for all inputs)

## Modules and Processes

(explain subroutines purposes and what they achieve)
(not all will be necessary)
(justify approaches)
## Algorithms

(pseudo code version of modules and processes)

## Data Structures and Validation

(class diagrams)
(variable tables)
(external file descriptions)
(explain any encoding)

## Identify Test Data

(find 6-10 milestones to achieve)
(find test conditions for each)
(make a test table for these)

## Identify Further Test Data

(Alpha beta and integration testing)
(involves the success criteria)
(justify these)
