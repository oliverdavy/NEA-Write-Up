## Project Definition

In the study, teaching, and performance of music the ability to practice effectively and efficiently is vital to success. A tool used for centuries is the metronome, a simple tool to create a consistent beat at a variable tempo. As well as this, one of the best ways to accelerate progress in practice is to use a practice log, a tool well renowned for its effectiveness throughout learning which helps learners keep a consistent track of what has been achieved, how it has been achieved, and where to improve next.  

I believe that to make musical practice more effective these tools should both be accessible together in a convenient location since they are both used within the same context, practice. 

My program will enable the user to set up a metronome to their requirements and be able to use this to aid their practice as they need it to, since this is not necessarily the same for all musicians (e.g. many jazz musicians will practice with the metronome only on two and four). It should also enable the user to write practice logs in a practical and structured manner, allowing them to record information effectively and quickly. Ideally it should also allow video or audio recordings to self-reflect on tone and technique.

## Stakeholders

I have identified three stakeholders for my product: musicians, music students, and music teachers. 

#### Musicians  

Musicians will often perform in many contexts, such as for gigs, auditions, etc. Joubert (2023) tells us that the ability to keep tempo is vital for performance and to play as the composer intended. Furthermore, the use of practice logs helps to record what has been practiced, allowing you to cover a lot of material in a short period of time without losing track. It also allows musicians to reflect in their practice time and if it is being used effectively (Dorman, 2016). 

#### Music Students 

Music students will have to learn pieces as assignments that push their abilities to improve their musical abilities. The use of a metronome is essential in learning difficult passages. A common technique among musicians at all levels is to practice at a slow speed until perfection, and then to slowly build up to the desired tempo (Duffy, 2024). The use of practice logs has been found to be useful throughout education. A study on Spanish speakers learning English found that practice logs have significant benefits to students. Feedback from tutors on their records was found to be constructive on their learning outside of lesson and helped improve the organisation of their time. The ability to reflect on learning also improved student attitude to learning as they have a physical track of their progress (Litzler, 2014). I believe very similar is achievable in music. 

#### Music Teachers 

Music teachers will often use metronomes to aid teaching, especially with beginners. Several methods have been identified by Lewis (1996) such as clapping to a metronome at various tempos to build a sense of rhythm within students. The use of logs can help teachers identify difficulties in student practice that might not be obvious within lesson. The ability to accurately see improvement helps teachers plan lessons effectively (Litzler, 2014).

#### Existing Systems

##### Metronome Online

![Metronome Online](/Metronome%20Online.png)
>Metronome Online

Metronome online is accessed via a web browser as a website ([https://www.metronomeonline.com/](https://www.metronomeonline.com/) Accessed at 2024/06/27). The metronome is presented as a circle where different BPMs are selected by clicking on labelled buttons around the circle. The start/stop button is prominent in the centre and shows the currently selected BPM. It also includes the Italian names for tempo. The two large arrows at the side allow for fine tuning of the tempo in increments of one BPM. Underneath the main UI is a timer for how long the metronome has run, a tap button to allow the desired metronome to be tapped in by the user, and a second timer for how long the metronome has run in total that day. Above is a small volume slider. To the left is a menu. Upon expansion (see below) the menu shows a variety of customisation options. These allow for variation in time signature, Sound style, Dark/Light mode, and to play an A at 440hz for tuning.

![Metronome Online Customisation Menu](/MetrOnlineMenu.png)
>Metronome Online Customisation Menu

The expanded menu allows for greater customisation, which is not an immediate necessity, unlike the other options shown in the main menu. The time signature has two drop downs to select the number of beats and the division of said beats. There is also a further settings menu next to this. The sound style also has a drop down to select the various sound options. The dark mode and tuner are toggled by simple switches.

![Metronome Online Time Sig. Customisation Menu](/MetrOnlineTimeMenu.png)
>Metronome Online Time Sig. Customisation Menu

The time signature settings show the same drop downs as one the previous menu. It also allows adjustment to the accent on each beat from four levels (zero to three). It shows the tempo below. It also allows for different subdivisions of time to be played each beat. It allows for no subdivision, duplets, triplets, and quintuplets. There is also a reset button

##### Google Metronome
 
 (google metronome)
 
 The google metronome is accessed directly from the browser by searching for metronome. It very simply has a text box to display the current BPM, a play/pause button, and a slider to select the BPM. The drop down below links to other tools like this made by Google and is not relevant to the tool itself. The colour of the UI changes with higher and lower BPMs varying from colder colours to warmer colours.

(google metronome warm)

##### Metronome Beats

(metronome beats image)

Metronome Beats is an app developed for android. It features several modes and advertises a paid pro-mode as well as linking to other apps made by the same developer. The header can open the side menu, a button which links to the tuner app, a button to buy pro-mode, and a button to open a volume slider. There are buttons at the top to pick between a few modes. The main metronome menu has lights to show which beat the metronome is on in the bar. There is also a slider which travels one full lap every two beats. The BPM indicator can be swiped up and down to pick BPM. There are also buttons to increment in ones and fives. The BPM can also be adjusted using a slider below. It also shows the corresponding Italian word for each BPM. The Beats/bar can be tapped to open a drop down to select the number of beats per bar. This updates the number of lights accordingly. The Clicks/beat also opens a drop down to adjust it when tapped. The Tap tempo button can be tapped by the user to input the BPM by tapping at the desired BPM. The bottom left button opens a tempo trainer button. There is a simple start/stop button. The bottom left button opens a timer menu.  

It also includes a simple programmable drum machine.

Add practice goals 

Edit behaviour of the log timer. Default will check for practice goals. If none it will use progress within hour. If at least one goal is set, then it will switch to goal progress. Progress within hour will just cycle between 0% to 100% every hour e.g. at 3 hours 45 mins it will show 75% because you are ¾ through the hour. Goal progress shows progress towards a set goal. E.g. if goal was 20 hours in a month and you had done 10 so far it will show 50%. Progress to fixed time setting will show how close a session is to reaching a specified time. E.g. if time set was 1 hour and you had done 15 minutes it would show ¼. 

Option to force phone to stay awake during session 

Logs can be imported and exported as CSV files as well as be wiped. Archives can also be exported or imported this way. 

There is a light and dark theme. Dark theme has OLED option

#### Stakeholder Needs

A google form was sent to stakeholders (musician friends). It asked what is essential in a metronome/practice tracker, and what is nice to have. 

The essentials for a metronome were: keeping track of rhythm 

- making sound 
- changing and showing speed
- range of selectable time signatures
- visual reference e.g. lights

Nice to have features of a metronome included:  

- being able to save presets
- changing the noise made
- beats per second instead of per minute  
- Vibration
- emphasis on certain beats
- ability to play over a song  
- list of popular music with their tempos and time signatures  

Essential features of practice log: 

- Date and duration of practice
- Record of what was practiced
- Notes e.g. good and bad parts, what to improve
- Ability to start and stop timer

Nice to have features of practice log: 

- Share option
- Statistics on practice
- Automatically start logging when app is open 
- Streaks (like duolingo)
- Session tags (e.g. scales, classical, etc.) perhaps linked to metronome presets 
- Attach sheet music 
- Instrument played

#### My Ideas and Approach

I agree most ideas that were presented by shareholders. I also think audio recordings should be added. Also changing visuals (theme options). 

## Features

The features to be added will have an essentiality level assigned. 

High = An essential feature for the app to be successful 

Medium = A feature that would greatly improve the apps usefulness, but not essential e.g. log notes 

Low = A feature that would be useful but not detrimental to the app if not included e.g. attach sheet music 

This is also affected by what stakeholders think is essential and what is useful

## Limitations

(talk about why I decided not to do some features. Justify why I decided they weren't feasible NOT JUST TIME the stuff below is just examples. You should come back and change this bit)

There were several proposed features decided not to be feasible to implement.

- Beats per second
	- Only wanted by one stakeholder. Would only complicate the program which could impede usefulness
- Attaching sheet music
	- Only wanted by one stakeholder. Likely to not be used by many users

## Computational Methods

This project is suitable for being solved computationally for several reasons. 

A metronome requires precise timing and works via logical steps to achieve its intended goal of keeping a consistent, user defined beats. These are both properties very well suited to computers, which follow logical steps and act very precisely. 

Practice logs require the ability to store and retrieve data, and for the implementation in this project it also needs to keep track of time and calculate statistics. Computers are able to store and retrieve data quickly and accurately, as well as perform complex calculations quickly. 

Furthermore, a computers ability to perform tasks concurrently would allow the practice log and metronome to be used at the same time, making this solution very versatile in its use.
