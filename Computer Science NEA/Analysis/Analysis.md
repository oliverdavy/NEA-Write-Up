# Project Definition

In the study, teaching, and performance of music the ability to practice effectively and efficiently is vital to success. A tool used for centuries is the metronome, a simple tool to create a consistent beat at a variable tempo. As well as this, one of the best ways to accelerate progress in practice is to use a practice log, a tool well renowned for its effectiveness throughout learning which helps learners keep a consistent track of what has been achieved, how it has been achieved, and where to improve next.  

I believe that to make musical practice more effective these tools should both be accessible together in a convenient location since they are both used within the same context, practice. 

My program will enable the user to set up a metronome to their requirements and be able to use this to aid their practice as they need it to, since this is not necessarily the same for all musicians (e.g. many jazz musicians will practice with the metronome only on two and four). It should also enable the user to write practice logs in a practical and structured manner, allowing them to record information effectively and quickly. Ideally it should also allow video or audio recordings to self-reflect on tone and technique.

# Stakeholders

I have identified three stakeholders for my product: musicians, music students, and music teachers. 

#### Musicians  

Musicians will often perform in many contexts, such as for gigs, auditions, etc. Joubert (2023) tells us that the ability to keep tempo is vital for performance and to play as the composer intended. Furthermore, the use of practice logs helps to record what has been practiced, allowing you to cover a lot of material in a short period of time without losing track. It also allows musicians to reflect in their practice time and if it is being used effectively (Dorman, 2016). 

#### Music Students 

Music students will have to learn pieces as assignments that push their abilities to improve their musical abilities. The use of a metronome is essential in learning difficult passages. A common technique among musicians at all levels is to practice at a slow speed until perfection, and then to slowly build up to the desired tempo (Duffy, 2024). The use of practice logs has been found to be useful throughout education. A study on Spanish speakers learning English found that practice logs have significant benefits to students. Feedback from tutors on their records was found to be constructive on their learning outside of lesson and helped improve the organisation of their time. The ability to reflect on learning also improved student attitude to learning as they have a physical track of their progress (Litzler, 2014). I believe very similar is achievable in music. 

#### Music Teachers 

Music teachers will often use metronomes to aid teaching, especially with beginners. Several methods have been identified by Lewis (1996) such as clapping to a metronome at various tempos to build a sense of rhythm within students. The use of logs can help teachers identify difficulties in student practice that might not be obvious within lesson. The ability to accurately see improvement helps teachers plan lessons effectively (Litzler, 2014).

#### Existing Systems

##### Metronome Online

![Metronome Online](Metronome%20Online.png)
>Metronome Online

Metronome online is accessed via a web browser as a website ([https://www.metronomeonline.com/](https://www.metronomeonline.com/) Accessed at 2024/06/27). The metronome is presented as a circle where different BPMs are selected by clicking on labelled buttons around the circle. The start/stop button is prominent in the centre and shows the currently selected BPM. It also includes the Italian names for tempo. The two large arrows at the side allow for fine tuning of the tempo in increments of one BPM. Underneath the main UI is a timer for how long the metronome has run, a tap button to allow the desired metronome to be tapped in by the user, and a second timer for how long the metronome has run in total that day. Above is a small volume slider. To the left is a menu. Upon expansion (see below) the menu shows a variety of customisation options. These allow for variation in time signature, Sound style, Dark/Light mode, and to play an A at 440hz for tuning.

![Metronome Online Customisation Menu](MetrOnlineMenu.png)
>Metronome Online Customisation Menu

The expanded menu allows for greater customisation, which is not an immediate necessity, unlike the other options shown in the main menu. The time signature has two drop downs to select the number of beats and the division of said beats. There is also a further settings menu next to this. The sound style also has a drop down to select the various sound options. The dark mode and tuner are toggled by simple switches.

![Metronome Online Time Sig. Customisation Menu](MetrOnlineTimeMenu.png)
>Metronome Online Time Sig. Customisation Menu

The time signature settings show the same drop downs as one the previous menu. It also allows adjustment to the accent on each beat from four levels (zero to three). It shows the tempo below. It also allows for different subdivisions of time to be played each beat. It allows for no subdivision, duplets, triplets, and quintuplets. There is also a reset button

##### Google Metronome
 
![Google Metronome](GoogleMetr.png)
>Google Metronome

 The google metronome is accessed directly from the browser by searching for metronome. It very simply has a text box to display the current BPM, a start/stop button, and a slider to select the BPM. The drop down below links to other tools like this made by Google and is not relevant to the tool itself. The colour of the UI changes with higher and lower BPMs varying from colder colours to warmer colours.

##### Metronome Beats

![Metronome Beats](metronomeBeats.png)
>Metronome Beats

Metronome Beats is an android app developed for use on mobile devices. It features two modes, a metronome and a drum machine. For this project, the metronome will be the focus of analysis.

The side menu features links to other apps by the same developer as well as premium features which have no impact on the metronomes use, so it will be ignored. The mode select allows for switching between the two different modes. While it may appear there are five modes, the middle button is a simplified drum machine, the generates poly-rhythms on the drum machine and does not open a separate page, and the last button prompts the user to purchase premium features; so for practical usage, there are only two modes.

The lights indicate which beat the metronome is currently on by turning on and off. The first beat is coloured differently for emphasis.

The sliding indicator moves linearly back and forth, returning to the start every other beat.

The increment and decrement buttons can adjust the BPM by one and five. The BPM display can also be used to adjust the BPM by scrolling it. The BPM slider can also be used to adjust the BPM. It also features a written tempo written above it, which changes based on the range the current BPM is within.

The beats/bar button opens a popup menu to change the amount of beats in each bar from one to sixteen. The clicks/beats button opens a popup menu to change the amount of click sounded per beats from one to sixteen. The tap tempo button adjusts the tempo to how often it is being pressed by the user.

The start/stop button is used to start and stop the metronome. The tempo trainer opens a separate screen to add a count in, increase and decrease tempo after a certain amount of time has passed, and add mute bars. the timer button opens a separate screen to add a count in, and stop the metronome after either a certain amount of bars, or a certain amount of time. It also allows the amount of time elapsed to be shown, but is off by default.

##### Musicalog

![Musicalog](Musicalog.png)
>Musicalog

The home page features two sections, one to show current goals (of which there are none by default), and one to show the progress of total time spent practising. There is a button to buy premium which will be ignored, as well as a button to start a new practice session. There is also a section at the bottom to switch between four pages, home, log, view, and options.

The log page shows a large button to start a practice session along with a smaller button to add previous practice sessions.

![musicalog default log page](musicalogLog.jpg) 
>Musicalog log page

When practice is started a stopwatch begins counting. At the bottom there is a pause button along with a button to end practice. There is also a button to create an archive. Archives are used to record audio.

![musicalog timer](musicalog%20timer.jpg)
>Musicalog Timer

Once the finish button is pressed a screen to save details about the practice log is opened. There are text fields to record instrument, date, time spent, as well as any notes. The instrument field can auto-fill common instrument names as well as changing the eighth note icon to match.

![musicalog save](musicalog%20save.jpg)
>Musicalog Save Session

On the view page previous practice sessions can be viewed and filtered by date and instrument. The total practice time progress tab is reused from the home page.

There are several possible behaviours for the timer during sessions, which are selectable from the options page. By default it will check if any practice goals are active. If none are found it will use progress within an hour. Progress within hour will cycle between zero percent to one hundred percent every hour e.g. at three hours forty five mins it will show seventy five because it is currently three quarters through the current hour. If at least one goal is set, then it will switch to goal progress.  Goal progress shows progress towards a set goal. e.g. if goal was twenty hours in a month and you had done ten so far it will show fifty percent. Progress within hour and Goal progress can both be set to be the default option. The final setting is Progress to fixed time which will show how close a session is to reaching a specified time. e.g. if time set was one hour and it had been fifteen minutes it would show twenty five percent. 

Logs can be imported and exported as CSV files as well as be completely wiped. Archives can also be exported or imported via CSV.

#### Stakeholder Needs

A google form was sent to stakeholders. It asked what they believe is essential in a metronome/practice tracker, and what is nice to have. 

The essentials for a metronome were: keeping track of rhythm 

- making sound 
- changing and showing speed
- range of selectable time signatures
- visual reference e.g. lights

Nice to have features of a metronome included:  

- being able to save presets
- changing the noise made
- beats per second instead of per minute  
- Vibration
- emphasis on certain beats
- ability to play over a song  
- list of popular music with their tempos and time signatures  

Essential features of practice log: 

- Date and duration of practice
- Record of what was practiced
- Notes e.g. good and bad parts, what to improve
- Ability to start and stop timer

Nice to have features of practice log: 

- Share option
- Statistics on practice
- Automatically start logging when app is opened
- Streaks (like duolingo)
- Session tags (e.g. scales, classical, etc.) perhaps linked to metronome presets 
- Attach sheet music 
- Instrument played

#### My Ideas and Approach

I agree with the ideas that were suggested by the shareholders. I also think audio recordings should be added, as I think it would be useful for reflecting on tone and intonation. Furthermore, I believe video recording could be added, but would be of less priority. I think this would be helpful in analysing technique

# Features

The features to be added will have an essentiality level assigned. 

High = An essential feature for the app to be successful 

Medium = A feature that would greatly improve the apps usefulness, but not essential e.g. log notes 

Low = A feature that would be useful but not detrimental to the app if not included e.g. attach sheet music 

This is also affected by what stakeholders think is essential and what is useful

# Limitations

There were several proposed features decided not to be feasible to implement which will be summarised here

| Feature                                        | Reason for exclusion                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Beats per second                               | Only wanted by one stakeholder. Would only complicate the program which could impede usefulness                                                                         |
| Attaching sheet music                          | Only wanted by one stakeholder. Would likely require users to provide their own sheet music files.                                                                      |
| Built in list of music and their BPMs          | Would require a large amount of additional research into several genres and would require frequent updating to remain useful.                                           |
| Automatically start logging when app is opened | May not be the desired function of the app, as users may wish to just review practice sessions rather than start practising, so this shouldn't be forced as the default |

# Computational Methods

This project is suitable for being solved computationally for several reasons. 

A metronome requires precise timing and works via logical steps to achieve its intended goal of keeping a consistent, user defined beats. These are both properties very well suited to computers, which follow logical steps and act very precisely. 

Practice logs require the ability to store and retrieve data, and for the implementation in this project it also needs to keep track of time and calculate statistics. Computers are able to store and retrieve data quickly and accurately, as well as perform complex calculations quickly. 

Furthermore, a computers ability to perform tasks concurrently would allow the practice log and metronome to be used at the same time, making this solution very versatile in its use.

| 5   | Store the date and time of practice sessions                                            | Will allow for a criteria for practice sessions to be sorted when presented to the user e.g. Sort by most recent                                                                                                                                  |
| 6   | Allow the user to record information about the quality of practice                      | Reflecting on practice requires user input on the quality of practice, helping to show what they need to work on. This should be quantitative ( e.g. one to five Star ranking) and qualitative ( e.g. two things done well, one thing to work on) |
| 7   | Allow the user to record information about what was practiced                           | Allows for a criteria for practice sessions to be sorted when presented to the user e.g. Sort by piece                                                                                                                                            |
| 8   | Time practice sessions                                                                  | Allows for quantitative data to be collected on practice sessions which can be used for statistics (e.g. time practiced this week) and as a sorting criteria (i.e. sort by time practiced)                                                        |
| 9   | Allow user to pause practice session timer and record breaks                            | Being able to take breaks is important to practice (cite this). Recording this allows for more collection of quantative data                                                                                                                      |
| 10  | Allow the user to review completed practice sessions                                    | Self reflection is important to improvement, hence the user should be able to look back on their practice                                                                                                                                         |
| 11  | Allow the user to share practice sessions                                               | Being able to share progress with peers and teachers aids development, by introducing a new perspective into improvement                                                                                                                          |
